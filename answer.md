 # Vineti Internship
1. _I'd like to be a part of your Dev team._
2. _I think programming language is just a toll for greater purposes so I like all of them. Each of them has its pros and cons._
3. _Linked list is an arraylike design structure which contains data and at least 1 element which is a link to the next or previous list element._
4. _I'd serve them by queue. First in the queue will be served and go away leaving his place to the second person and new customers will be going to fill the queue from the end._
5. _I will test a pen this way i think_ 
* I'll check if there are some ink
* Try to write with it  
6. _I will test transaction security at first even before authentification and other things. I think security is the first thing you should care about_

8. _The angle between hour and minute hand is equal to the sector angle between them so if we devide 360/12 we'll get the angle between the successive hours and at 3:20 we got our hands at 3 and 4 numbers so the angle is 30._

13. _If we consider that 'AAABCCDDDD' and 'A3BC2D4' characters are the same encoding(so the size of one character is equal) the compression for storage is logical becouse the first one uses more characters than the second, but the process of converting is way more time consuming and memory using so if the string is very large maybe is the only case when converting makes sense_ .

15. _I'd use OOP principles to construct something big like toster or vending machine etc. By that way you can use classes(or prototypes) and inheritance for reusing your code, encapsulation for code protection, polymorphism for greate mobility, abstraction for making big things smaller and simpler to construct and other powerful features that are suggested by modern object oriented programming._
16. _I will start from the first floor and drop the lightbulb, if it didn't break I will take the same lightbulb and try from the one floor higher and do the same untill the lightbulb will be broken._
17. _I have 2 choices I think to place the pillars by width (anyway it will fit if the room is square) and the second variant is to place pillars on the 4 corners of the room._
18. _We can tame 3 groups of balls each one consisting from 3 balls. Then if we weigh 2 groups we can have only 3 possible chances balanced, the first group heavier, the second heavier. If it's balanced we can say that the heavy ball is in the third group and weigh 2 balls from third group. We get the same. It can be balanced, the right one heavier and the left one heavier, so if its balanced the heavy ball is the one that we didn't weigh, if right is heavier the it is the heavier if left the that. Let's get back to the first weighing there are still 2 possible chances. Right one heavier and second one heavier if the right is heavier we weigh 2 balls from that group separately and if left then from left. So the answer is we get only 2 weighings to find the heavier ball or we can do the same reverse way to find the lightweight._
